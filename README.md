Hey guys, q here, we boutta cook with this one.
so firstly, you probablly wanna install python
then you gotta go in your terminal and type 'pip install keyboard', and if that doesnt work do 'pip3 install keyboard'
and then you can just run the file from the terminal
type 'python ' (the space is important) and then drag the file into the terminal

it should be noted that this game runs faster on the vscode terminal for some reason. If you want the best experience, play it from there.
